As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A CloudFormation stack that contains the following resources:
** An EventBridge Rule that detects ECR Image Action events for successful image pushes.
** A Lambda function for filtering ECR Image Action events that match the filters provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters.
** A Lambda function for generating SOCI indices for matched images and pushing those indices back to images' repositories in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide the following:
*** Permission for Amazon EventBridge to invoke the Filtering Lambda function.
*** Permission for the Filtering Lambda function to create CloudWatch Logs and to invoke the SOCI Index Generator Lambda function.
*** Permission for the SOCI Index Generator Lambda function to create CloudWatch Logs and access ECR.
* Amazon CloudWatch for logs from both Lambda functions that you can use to troubleshoot.
